
TTFPATCH v1.0 - (C) by Wolfram Esser [wok@derwok.de] 2001-02-23

TTFPATCH is a Win32 commandline tool, which provides an easy way for font 
designers to set the 'embeddable' flags of their own true type fonts. 
TTFPATCH comes as Windows 32-bit executable and with complete C++ sourcecode.
So if you like, you can build your own binary for your OS platform. 
TTFPATCH has no graphical user interface, it is a commandline tool.

Download current version here:

Usage examples:
---------------
If you (as the font designer) want to PROHIBIT embedding of your font
e.g. in Adobe Acrobat PDF files, simply run: 

     ttfpatch myfont.ttf 2

On the other hand, if you (as the font designer) decide to ALLOW the
users of your font to embed your font into documents (like Adobe Acrobat
PDF files), then you should run e.g.:

     ttfpatch myfont.ttf 4

If you are not(!) the designer / copyright holder of a font, you are not 
allowed to use this tool to change the fsType value of a given TrueType 
font! Respect the copyright of the font designer!

Usage: 
     ttfpatch TrueTypeFontFile [NewFsTypeValue]

fsType values:
       0: embedding for permanent installation
       1: reserved - do not use!
       2: embedding restricted (not allowed!)
       4: embedding for preview & printing allowed
       8: embedding for editing allowed

Hint: fsType values can be added. So a fsType value of '12' 
(which is 4 + 8) means set 'embedding for preview&printing
allowed' and set 'embedding for editing allowed'.
